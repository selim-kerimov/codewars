 * Greed is a dice game played with five six-sided dice. Your mission, should you choose 
 * to accept it, is to score a throw according to these rules. You will always be given an 
 * array with five six-sided dice values.
 * 
 * - Three 1's => 1000 points
 * - Three 6's =>  600 points
 * - Three 5's =>  500 points
 * - Three 4's =>  400 points
 * - Three 3's =>  300 points
 * - Three 2's =>  200 points
 * - One   1   =>  100 points
 * - One   5   =>   50 point
 * 
 * Each of 5 dice can only be counted once in each roll. For example, a given "5" 
 * can only count as part of a triplet (contributing to the 500 points) or as a single 
 * 50 points, but not both in the same roll.
 * 
 * Example scoring
 * - 5 1 3 4 1   250:  50 (for the 5) + 2 * 100 (for the 1s)
 * - 1 1 1 3 1   1100: 1000 (for three 1s) + 100 (for the other 1)
 * - 2 4 4 5 4   450:  400 (for three 4s) + 50 (for the 5)
